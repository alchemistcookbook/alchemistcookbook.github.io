A new study completed by scientists from the University of San Francisco, published in Nature: International Weekly Journal of Science, on March 22, 2017 has, for the first time, directly identifed the lungs as a "primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable haematopoietic potential."

In a press release article by UCSF; Public Information Representative, Nicholas Weiler interviewed the study's senior author, pulmonologist Mark R. Looney, MD, a professor of medicine and of laboratory medicine at UCSF.  He says, “This finding definitely suggests a more sophisticated view of the lungs – that they’re not just for respiration but also a key partner in formation of crucial aspects of the blood. ...What we’ve observed here in mice strongly suggests the lung may play a key role in blood formation in humans as well.”

Also interviewed was Guadalupe Ortiz-Muñoz, co-first author of the study. Guadalupe says, "It's possible that the lung is an ideal bioreactor for platelet production because of the mechanical force of the blood, or perhaps because of some molecular signaling we don't yet know about."
